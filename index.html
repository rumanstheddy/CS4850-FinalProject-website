        <h2>Additional Instructions</h2>
        <ol style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
            <li> Navigate to the ./Engine folder.</li>
            <li> run the command: python3 build_tile_editor.py</li>
            <li> From the same folder, run the command: ./bin/tile_editor.exe tilewidth tileheight, where tilewidth
                and
                tileheight are integers representing the dimensions of a single tile</li>
            <li> Left click on a tile in the menu to select the tile.</li>
            <li> You can insert multiple tiles quickly by dragging the cursor across the screen whil holding the left
                mouse button down.</li>
            <li> You can also erase tiles by clicking the grid with the right mouse button</li>
            <li> Use the arrow keys to move the camera</li>
            <li> After you exit the tiel editor, your tilemap is automatically saved and will automatically load when
                the
                next game begins.</li>
        </ol>

            <!-- Post mortem goes here -->
            For our game engine, we followed Unityâ€™s game engine style of being a script based game engine. We wanted to
            give our users flexibility to create their own type of game. The users are able to create their own classes
            (based on GameObject) and add (or not add) various components such as the SpriteComponent,
            TransformComponent, SoundComponent, etc. The user can also determine if they want their object to be an
            AnimateObject or a PlayerObject (which they both inherit from the GameObject class). We included a tile
            editor GUI to let the users quickly and easily create their tilemaps with a spritesheet. In general, we feel
            that we have created a well structured and flexible game engine that gives great flexibility and freedom to
            the users on what type of game they want to create.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our special game feature is the gravitational fields that can be created through our game engine. We created
            a realistic physics engine that simulates a gravitational pull, such as planet orbit systems. We were able
            to do this by creating a universal force that attracts GameObjects in a circular/elliptical motion. The user
            can modify the gravitational radinal strength and area. Additionally, this game engine can be utilized as a
            simulator for planetary orbits and planetary systems. The gravitational pulls in our physics engine can
            simulate realistic orbits whilst allowing the user to customize and simulate various scientific experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the hardships we faced were creating a realistic and functional collision between the different
            types of GameObjects (AnimateObject and PlayerObject as well). We did this by creating callbacks to handle
            events from python (which the user can modify) for specific objects. Similarly, we utilized callback
            methodology to set up our controllers. Another hardship was initially figuring out how to create a script
            based game engine that is easy to program and give users great flexibility. We envisioned the Unity game
            engine with Component features where the users can add components at free will to create their own unique
            classes and GameObjects. We thought python/pybind was an easy scripting language that new users can easily
            utilize as well, especially with all of the methods provided through PyBind.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, we think that our game engine was successful. We were able to include various game engine
            elements and techniques into ours such as the resource manager, tile editor, gameobject components, physics
            engine, etc. We were able to work effectively as a team (distributing tasks and communicating constantly to
            update others). However, there are definitely new features that we would like to implement for the future. A
            feature we would like to implement is the support of 3D games. Our emphasis was on realistic orbits in 2D.
            We think it will be really exciting (and challenging) to create a 3D physics engine that supports 3D
            gravitational orbits. This will allow for a more realistic and exciting gameplay and game design.
