        <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Levels
                <p>
                    Our game currently supports only one level so first thing to improve or work upon would adding more
                    levels. Also, the level right now is fairly simple to play, making it more challenging and also more
                    engaging could be fun.
                </p>
            <li>Main Menu and Pause Screen
                <p>
                    When a user starts up the game, they are taken directly into it without any menu for navigation. A
                    Main menu to start, read instructions, select levels and quit the game needs to be implemented.
                    Also, we might have to add a Pause functionality and a Pause screen to the game to improve the user
                    experience.
                </p>
            <li>Multiple Language Support
                <p>
                    The game currently supports English to display text on screen. Additional language support can be
                    added.
                </p>
            <li>Collisions
                <p>
                    Collision logic in the game is simple and does most of the job. But when the player can see some
                    jagged movement while colliding with the tiles. A much robust collision detection and response
                    physics needs to added to make the player movement smooth and seamless.
                </p>
            <li>Enemy AI
                <p>
                    Enemy AI in our game has a simple behavior - patrol a given line from one edge to the other. This
                    can be improved upon by making the AI pursue the player in a given range or zone.
                </p>
            <li>Fighting back
                <p>
                    The player cannot attack or cause damage to the enemies present in the game. We want that to change:
                    giving the player a weapon such as a sword or making the player eliminate enemies by jumping on them
                    in Mario fashion can be be worked upon.
                </p>
            <li>Different Tile properties
                <p>
                    All the tiles in the game have a simple physics component which checks for collisions and performs
                    the necessary collision response. We would like to add custom properties to certain tiles such as
                    making them more slippery, dishing out damage when walked upon etc.
                </p>
        </ul>

        <p>Use this <a href="./documentation/index.html">link</a> to go to the documentation page.</p>

        <h3>Instructions: using the Tile Editor</h3>
        <p>The tile editor has two options PNG and BMP
            For PNG, the best results are achieved when the tiles are provided as individual png tiles and they are
            rendered at their original resoultion. The tile editor
            can scroll infinitely so this the dimensions are not an issue.
            In case of PNG, the names of the tiles should be numbers in increasing order like 0.png, 1.png, etc. You can
            see such a sample in Assets folder.
            To create a tile map, you simply need to enter these names seperated by a single whitespace. If the format
            is incorrect tiles will not be render. You can click the "Update Config" button to see if what you have
            entered is valid or not.</p>
        <p>
            Loading and Saving tile maps.
            All tile maps are loaded from and saved to Assets/TileMaps folder. And the names of the file have to be
            relative to that. For instance, a sample map has been provided which was created using assets available in
            the folder - sample1.txt.
            To see how this map looks, you simply need to click "Load Map" and type sample1.txt in the file name. The
            map should be loaded.
            You can now use arrow keys to navigate around.</p>
        <p>
            BMP works in a similar way in terms of loading and saving, the only difference is that tile editor only
            supports equal sized tiles and these tiles should be from a single bmp file located in
            Assets/Tiles/bmp/Tiles.bmp. In this case also you will enter numbers, for tiles but numbers here represent
            the individual tiles that are generated when you slice the bmp image into small rectangles of given width
            and height. You will be asked to enter this information if you select bmp. </p>
